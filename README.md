📌 Project: Python List Practice Questions 

📝 Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic and intermediate Python list exercises designed to strengthen core programming skills. Each script demonstrates how to manipulate lists using fundamental logic and control structures, without relying heavily on built-in shortcuts.
The project is structured to showcase problem-solving approaches for common list operations, making it a valuable resource for beginners and a solid addition to a technical portfolio.
🔑 Features
Basic List Operations

Create and print lists

Access first and last elements

Count elements without len()

Add/modify elements using indexing

Accept user inputs into lists

Iterate and filter even numbers

Count occurrences of target values

Calculate sums without sum()

Intermediate List Operations

Find largest and smallest elements without max() or min()

Reverse lists without slicing

Remove duplicates without set()

Check membership with boolean logic

Print elements at even/odd indices

Count even and odd numbers separately

Generate squared values list

Combine two lists without + or extend()

Remove negative numbers

Find the second largest element without sorting

Perform cyclic shifts

Verify ascending order

🎯 Purpose
